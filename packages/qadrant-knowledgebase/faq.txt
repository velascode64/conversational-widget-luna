therapist has been confirmed and is officially on the calendar. A scheduled callback from our
Concierge Team is not a therapy appointment. Instead, it’s a time for our team to call you,
answer any questions, and help you complete your onboarding process—including confirming
your benefits and scheduling your first PT visit. If you’ve received a confirmation for a callback,
that’s your opportunity to get set up for care—but your first visit hasn’t been booked yet.

"
ID: 8 | QUESTION: "What do all the insurance terms mean?" |
ANSWER: "1) Deductible - The amount a patient pays for health care services before their
health insurance begins to pay for visits/services. This is typically reset annually, at the time of
insurance renewal. A patient is responsible for the entire cost of health services received until
the patient has paid the deductible amount for health services. 2) Remaining Deductible - The
amount of money you still need to pay for healthcare services before your health insurance
helps cover the cost. At the start, you pay for all your healthcare expenses until you meet your
annual deductible. Once you reach that amount, your insurance starts sharing the cost. The
remaining deductible shows how much more you have to pay before your insurance pays more.
3) Co-Pay - The fixed amount a patient pays for a health care service, determined by the
insurance company for a specific service, paid for at the time of service. 4) Co-Insurance - The
percentage of a medical charge that a patient pays after a deductible has been met, with the
rest paid by your health insurance plan.
